* emacs-copilot-sdk-examples

Example applications built on [[https://github.com/ewilderj/emacs-copilot-sdk][copilot-sdk.el]], a pure Emacs Lisp
client for the GitHub Copilot SDK.

By [[https://github.com/ewilderj][Edd Wilder-James]], co-authored with [[https://github.com/features/copilot][GitHub Copilot]].

** Prerequisites

- Emacs 29.1+
- [[https://github.com/ewilderj/emacs-copilot-sdk][copilot-sdk.el]] on your =load-path=
- The =copilot= CLI binary on =$PATH=
- A valid GitHub Copilot token (=GH_TOKEN= or =copilot auth=)

** Examples

*** echo-bot — Hello World

Bare minimum: connect, send one message, print response, disconnect.
~35 lines.  Proves the SDK works end-to-end.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'copilot-echo-bot)
M-x copilot-echo-bot
#+end_src

*** docstring — Generate Docstrings

Place point inside a function, run =M-x copilot-docstring=, and it
generates and inserts an idiomatic docstring.  Supports Emacs Lisp,
Python, JavaScript, Go, and more.  Uses =claude-haiku-4.5= for speed.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'copilot-docstring)
M-x copilot-docstring
#+end_src

*** commit-message — AI Commit Messages

Stage your changes, run =M-x copilot-commit=, and get a
Conventional Commits message in a vc-style popup buffer.  Edit
freely, then =C-c C-c= to commit, =C-c C-k= to cancel, or
=C-c C-r= to regenerate.  Uses =claude-haiku-4.5= for speed.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'copilot-commit-message)
M-x copilot-commit
#+end_src

*** org-process — AI Inbox Processor

Point it at any org buffer with rough notes and it walks through
each entry, classifying it (TODO, reference, event, someday),
cleaning up the heading, suggesting tags, deadlines, and refile
targets.  A GTD weekly review assistant.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'copilot-org-process)
;; Open an org file, then:
M-x copilot-org-process
#+end_src

Keybindings in the review buffer:

| Key | Action                          |
|-----+---------------------------------|
| =a= | Accept suggestion               |
| =e= | Edit heading, then accept       |
| =s= | Skip entry                      |
| =r= | Regenerate suggestion           |
| =q= | Quit                            |

*** tool-agent — Tool Use with Permissions

An interactive chat agent that demonstrates tool registration,
dispatch, and a tiered permission model.  The agent can read files,
list directories, get file metadata, and tell the time.

Each tool has a risk level:
- =:safe= — runs without asking (e.g. =get_current_time=)
- =:ask= — prompts the user: =[y]es= this turn, =[a]lways=, =[n]o=

Saying "yes" auto-approves that tool for the rest of the turn,
so you aren't re-prompted when a tool is called repeatedly.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'copilot-tool-agent)
M-x copilot-tool-agent
#+end_src
